## 14 October '19
5 min presentations excluding questions
possibly include tinder captcha mode
maybe include a picture in the slide (maybe just a few icons), easier to get people's attention
we shouldn't worry about integration 
it's possible to get computer-generated tags at any time
backend: no experience with java servers, not sure which language/framework is appropriate/best here. django or flask would be possibilites, up to us. preexisting stuff uses python
database: free to choose 

further meetings if necessary, schedule via e-mail. communication via e-mail or skype
next things: upload presentation today, presentation wednesday

### Game Modes
- two-player mode is already old
- few players online, asynchronous play? bots?
- multiple rounds of play for one image with different people
- restrict popular keywords after a few rounds
- Entry requirement, e.g. quiz

### Technology

JavaScript for frontend? Google MDL? Constraints on communication, keep track of sessions. API for game possible

Previous stuff uses MongoDB

Handle possible translation of human language after prototype

CityStories has many datasets without tags, we're probably going to get a small subset.
In JSON format.

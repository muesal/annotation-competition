# Notes
27 January

Standardized UX questionnaires are available, maybe for future
work. 'Usability and user experience' Davis 1989?
Talking during video: maybe
Video style: have a look at DBIS youtube channel. Maybe have voice if there's time.
Video title screen with seminar, group and individual names
We are group 14, probably
mention pretraining in slides and explain why it's useful (also useful against spam)
Give Shaban full access to repo
Shaban can give us access to a cloud server, show IPs in presentation not domain name
Jonas could provide a server but would need a domain because of certificates
Entry quiz could also use a fixed number of rounds and e.g. a 70% threshold
Many references are possible for linguistics. 
We can cite CRSF paper
We could have a visual representation of schema
Try not to have redundancy between video and screenshots in slides
Have at least a slide on NLP
VGG as explanation for why it's modern human machine interaction
Plenty of potential data sets are poorly annotated, this is motivation for the annotation competition
Mention gamification part

14 January
Get mobile running
Make GUI nicer
Try to increase performance
Shaban has a look at whether we get a server
Shaban is looking for offline translation 
Invite Shaban to GitLab repo
Next meeting 27 January 15:00


05 December

automatic labels - pretrained models, we're going to receive the files
semantic distance to provided labels
nlp



06 November

seminar presentation
if papers go into details, it's not necessary to use further publications
15 mins presentation, 5 questions
no hand-in in advance
hand in midterm slide on adam

discuss seminar presentations 03 December 13:00 


project
google mdl should make integration easier
Wordnet or something like that for semantic issues (good thing to mention in midterm presentation alongside spell checking )




04 November '19

Planning the API: 
Dynamic requests with RESTful API and JSON and stuff. Use GET and POST requests. 

Errors: 400, 401, 403, 404 and stuff for GET requests. Give further information in JSON.
	


No user data in prototype.

Commands see Salome's notes. 


## 22 October '19
* We'll use Python and the Flask Framework (https://gitlab.com/55683-01/annotation-competition/issues/1)
* We'll use an SQL/relational Database (https://gitlab.com/55683-01/annotation-competition/issues/2)
  * Salome will start with the game logic
  * Andreas will start with a prototype of the interface
  * Jonas will start with database


## 14 October '19
5 min presentations excluding questions
possibly include tinder captcha mode
maybe include a picture in the slide (maybe just a few icons), easier to get people's attention
we shouldn't worry about integration 
it's possible to get computer-generated tags at any time
backend: no experience with java servers, not sure which language/framework is appropriate/best here. django or flask would be possibilites, up to us. preexisting stuff uses python
database: free to choose 

further meetings if necessary, schedule via e-mail. communication via e-mail or skype
next things: upload presentation today, presentation wednesday


## 07 October \'19

### Game Modes
- two-player mode is already old
- few players online, asynchronous play? bots?
- multiple rounds of play for one image with different people
- restrict popular keywords after a few rounds
- Entry requirement, e.g. quiz

### Technology

JavaScript for frontend? Google MDL? Constraints on communication, keep track of sessions. API for game possible

Previous stuff uses MongoDB

### Language
Handle possible translation of human language after prototype

### Datasets
CityStories has many datasets without tags, we're probably going to get a small subset.
In JSON format.

### TODO
- One slide presentation
  - present game logic
- further proposal with game modes and their priorities until 09 October

### Data Access
We should get it this week.

### Next meeting 14 October 13:00

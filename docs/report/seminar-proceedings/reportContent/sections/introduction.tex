Gamification is a tool to motivate humans to participate in an activity. This can be combined with crowdsourcing efforts. Our project aims to be a gamified crowdsourcing effort for large image data sets. The game differs from previously described implementations as it is asynchronous. To this end, we designed two distinct game modes, one to provide tags for an image and one to assess quality. The resulting game is a web application which can be easily accessed via a web browser.
